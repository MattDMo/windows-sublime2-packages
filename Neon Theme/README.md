# Neon-sublime-theme
###### I renamed the package from `Neon.tmTheme` as the directory name was confusing Sublime (and I assume would TextMate as well), and Github automatically redirects from the old name, so why not? This will also make it easier for when I submit to [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

Neon is a cool bright-on-black theme for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)/[ST3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com) (versions 1 and [2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate)). Used mainly for [Python](http://www.python.org), but lots of languages look good with it, like JavaScript, XML, CSS, shell scripts, Clojure (could use some work), Fortran (really!), PHP, R, Ruby, LaTeX, Markdown/reStructuredText, and more. It's also great when using wuub's fantastic [SublimeREPL](https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL) plugin, which I can't say enough good things about. Java looks OK, but I tend to avoid it.

There are a bunch of scopes in here that are only found in my [PythonImproved](https://github.com/MattDMo/PythonImproved) `.tmLanguage` syntax file &mdash; [IPython](http://www.ipython.org) `In`/`Out` statements, [Django](http://djangoproject.org)-specific highlighting (from [Djaniero](https://github.com/squ1b3r/Djaneiro)), and a bunch of improvements from facelessuser's [Better Python](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-languages/tree/master/Better%20Python), along with various enhancements, extensions, and bug fixes of my own. If you work with Python, I'd highly recommend getting it.

=======
I'm always tweaking and adding things, so the preview pix may not closely match the actual theme. YMMV.

## Installation for Sublime Text 2
In `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User` (OSX), `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User` (Windows), or `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User` (Linux):

    git clone git://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-sublime-theme.git 

This will create a menu option `Neon` under `Preferences->Color Scheme->User`. Once available through Package Control, the menu option will probably be something along the lines of `Preferences->Color Scheme->Neon Theme->Neon`. A donation might convince me to implement a Package Control version very soon! (wink wink nudge nudge)

## TextMate Installation:
    
    git clone git://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-sublime-theme.git ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Themes
    
Or, you can just download the [.zip file](https://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-sublime-theme/archive/master.zip) and put it in the proper theme directory yourself.

## Customization

While I really like the level of control I get with Sublime's system of config files, editing themes by hand (in XML) is rough. So, I keep the main copies of my themes in the TextMate folder so I can use its theme editor for tweaks. In `~/Library/Application Support/` I then run `ln -s TextMate/Themes/Neon.tmTheme "Sublime Text 2/Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Neon.tmTheme"` to symlink it to Sublime.

I'd also recommend checking out aziz's [tmTheme-Editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/), but alas it currently only works with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/â€Ž) at the moment because of some the HTML5 APIs it uses. Regardless, it's a pretty neat app, and **Neon.tmTheme** should be listed on there soon!

## Issues
Sometimes the same file looks different in TextMate and Sublime Text 2. It may be that the scopes are defined somewhat differently, or that the parsers don't work in quite the same way. Hack the `.tmlanguage` definition files if you're interested.
