        Provides a secure way for distribution of SSL CA certificates

        Unfortunately Python does not include a bundle of CA certs with urllib2
        to perform SSL certificate validation. To circumvent this issue,
        Package Control acts as a distributor of the CA certs for all HTTPS
        URLs of package downloads.

        The default channel scrapes and caches info about all packages
        periodically, and in the process it checks the CA certs for all of
        the HTTPS URLs listed in the repositories. The contents of the CA cert
        files are then hashed, and the CA cert is stored in a filename with
        that hash. This is a fingerprint to ensure that Package Control has
        the appropriate CA cert for a domain name.

        Next, the default channel file serves up a JSON object of the domain
        names and the hashes of their current CA cert files. If Package Control
        does not have the appropriate hash for a domain, it may retrieve it
        from the channel server. To ensure that Package Control is talking to
        a trusted authority to get the CA certs from, the CA cert for
        sublime.wbond.net is bundled with Package Control. Then when downloading
        the channel file, Package Control can ensure that the channel file's
        SSL certificate is valid, thus ensuring the resulting CA certs are
        legitimate.

        As a matter of optimization, the distribution of Package Control also
        includes the current CA certs for all known HTTPS domains that are
        included in the channel, as of the time when Package Control was
        last released.
